The next morning I begin to consider of means to put this
resolve into execution; but I was at a great loss about my tools.  I had
three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets
for traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty
hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a
grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.  This cost me as
much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of
politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man.  At length I
contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might
have both my hands at liberty.  _Note_.—I had never seen any such thing
in England, or at least, not to take notice how it was done, though since
I have observed, it is very common there; besides that, my grindstone was
very large and heavy.  This machine cost me a full week’s work to bring
it to perfection.
