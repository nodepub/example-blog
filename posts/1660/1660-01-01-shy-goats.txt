Very hot still: but I went abroad early and late with my
gun, and lay still in the middle of the day.  This evening, going farther
into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I found
there were plenty of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to come at;
however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.
