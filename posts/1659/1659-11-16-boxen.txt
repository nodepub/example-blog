These three days I spent in making little square
chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most,
of powder; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure
and remote from one another as possible.  On one of these three days I
killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.
