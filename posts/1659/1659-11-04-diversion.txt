This morning I began to order my times of work, of going out
with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion—viz. every morning I
walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then
employed myself to work till about eleven o’clock; then eat what I had to
live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessively hot; and then, in the evening, to work again.  The working
part of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making my table,
for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me
a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any
one else.
