It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind;
during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little
harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her,
and that only at low water.  I spent this day in covering and securing
the goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.
