This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a wild
cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every creature
that I killed I took of the skins and preserved them.  Coming back by the
sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but
was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three seals, which,
while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea,
and escaped me for that time.
