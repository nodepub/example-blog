This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to make
room for my further conveniency.

Three things I wanted exceedingly for this workâ€”viz. a pickaxe, a
shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and
began to consider how to supply that want, and make me some tools.  As
for the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough,
though heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so
absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually
without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.
