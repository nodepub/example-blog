I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked
during a dreadful storm in the offing, came on shore on this dismal,
unfortunate island, which I called “The Island of Despair”; all the rest
of the ship’s company being drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal
circumstances I was brought to—viz. I had neither food, house, clothes,
weapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw nothing
but death before me—either that I should be devoured by wild beasts,
murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food.  At the
approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but
slept soundly, though it rained all night.
