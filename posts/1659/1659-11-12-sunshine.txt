Now it began to be settled fair weather.  The 7th, 8th, 9th,
10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up to
make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but
never to please me; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces several
times.

**Note** â€” I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for
them on my post, I forgot which was which.
