This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and cooled
the earth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning,
which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder.  As soon as it was
over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many little
parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.
